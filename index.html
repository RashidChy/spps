                  <p>An enthusiastic learner, interested in advancing technologies and always hungry to learn about new things. Currently I am more intrigued by web development and in a phase of learning new scripting languages and interesting frameworks. I might pursue my career in web development sector however yet I am not completely sure whether I would like to introduce myself as a front-end or a back-end developer.  </p>

                        <p>I am Mohammed Nafiur Rashid Chowdhury currently studying at a reputed university in Bangladesh. Currently, I am on my way to complete my undergrad in computer science and engineering. Here, basically I am gaining knowledge about higher mathematics, electrical circuits, and components alongside computer science, networking, and numerous programming languages. Although I have gone through many different programming languages learned about different development sectors, the Web development sector pulled my interest into it. I am currently completing my 7th semester and besides my academics I'm trying to explore more about the Web and its development scopes. I would like to see myself as a Web developer in the near future and have dreams of becoming a part of something big. </p>

                        <p>It's been only few months since I started exploring the web development sector. An interesting sector indeed with a whole lot of areas yet to know about and learn. So far within few couple of days of my learning, I gathered little bit of knowledge on Html5, some CSS3, also peaked into the most popular CSS framework called BootStrap. Here are few projects I worked on so far out of enthusiasm.</p>

                        <p>While mostly focusing on Frontend , little did I try to explore PHP and some JavaScript and almost managed to pull out a project based on PHP. But definitely looking forward to work on learing more about back-end languages and maybe soon would want to make myself comfortable with a Framework.</p>

                              This is the first programming Language I learned and hence I am yet the most comfortable with this language. With "comfortable" I mean, I prefer this language the most when I am given a problem to solve. I possess a moderate knowledge on Object Oriented Programming concepts in C++ . Although most of the programming I did in my life is in this language, I have almost no visual project to showcase on this language. But I solved all my Data-Structure and Algorithm problems using c++.</p>

                        <p>I quite enjoyed this language while I was learning, though I did not choose this language out of interest but took it since it was in my university course curriculum. In this language, I was encouraged to work on Graphical User Interface for the first time. I learned some .NET frameworks throughout my course and completed a "Point of Sales" project. After completion of my course, I have not quite dug deeper into C#, but I really look forward to it.

                        <p>I was first introduced to java during my second semester.I found it to be quite similar to c++ but didn't really get to explore the depths of the language because it was a short semester. But I'm familiar with the concept of the object oriented programming that java envelopes, as I had to do a console application project with it. I might explore java more, if I get the chance to work with it again in the future.</p>

                              I've only just started learning python in order to explore the world of Data Science. I don't have much experience in using it in problem solving or in any project, but I'm quite looking forward to gaining more knowledge on it. </p>

                              <p>SQL is a must-know language to work with back-end, but I did not learn it because I had to but because I enjoyed while learning it. I have a proper understanding of SQL joins subquery, and different other SQL functions and a fair understanding of Normalization and database schemas. Three of my projects include the usage of SQL for database management. Mostly, I worked with Oracle and MySql Server.</p>

                                    Data structures and algorithms is a field that greatly peaked my interest, because I gained knowledge about these from really good faculties of my university, who made the topics quite clear and interesting. I understood all the aspects taught to me distinctly and could thus solve problems, including different types of searching and sorting and methods like greedy approach or divide and conquer, quite efficiently </p>
